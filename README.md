# DriftersProject

This repo contains files made by Ruben Scheffer and Ivo Goede during our project for the "Making Analyzing and Interpreting Observations" course at the Utrecht University in october 2020. 
We choose to make our work publicly available and free to use by anyone. The "Calculate_angles_bearing" and "Data_reader" script can be used to calculate the Diffusivity as specified by Visser in 2008. 
The scripts "Diffusivity_ruhs" and "Data_reader_ruhs_method" calculate the diffusion using the method from RÃ¼hs 2018. The raw data can be found at:  ftp://ftp.aoml.noaa.gov/pub/phod/buoydata/. 

We wish you good luck!
